## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# ATL Average Departure Delay by Day of the Week
data <- data.frame(
  Day = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"),
  Avg_Dep_Delay = c(14.109375, 14.62206835, 19.0794702, 30.18922984, 20.11429382, 9.906021384, 7.558184765)
)

# Plot the data using ggplot2
ggplot(data, aes(x = Day, y = Avg_Dep_Delay)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue") +
  geom_line(color = "red") +  # Add a line connecting the points
  labs(title = "ATL Average Departure Delay by Day of the Week",
   	x = "Day of the Week",
   	y = "Average Departure Delay (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal() +  # Set a minimalistic theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

# DFW Average Departure Delay by Day of the Week
data <- data.frame(
  Day = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"),
  Avg_Dep_Delay = c(14.109375, 14.62206835, 19.0794702, 30.18922984, 20.11429382, 9.906021384, 7.558184765)
)

# Plot the data using ggplot2
ggplot(data, aes(x = Day, y = Avg_Dep_Delay)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue") +
  geom_line(color = "red") +  # Add a line connecting the points
  labs(title = "ATL Average Departure Delay by Day of the Week",
   	x = "Day of the Week",
   	y = "Average Departure Delay (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal() +  # Set a minimalistic theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

# ORD Average Departure Delay by Day of the Week
data <- data.frame(
  Day = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"),
  Avg_Dep_Delay = c(10.9, 17.3, 21.1, 25.3, 10.5, 8.6, 6.5)
)

# Plot the data using ggplot2
ggplot(data, aes(x = Day, y = Avg_Dep_Delay)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue") +
  geom_line(color = "red") +  # Add a line connecting the points
  labs(title = "DFW Average Departure Delay by Day of the Week",
   	x = "Day of the Week",
   	y = "Average Departure Delay (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal() +  # Set a minimalistic theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
