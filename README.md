## Section 1: Software and Platform Section
    Google Sheets/Excel was used to clean and filter the data. This was chosen because there are 
    built in sort features to filter out the ORIGIN column and allow us to easily add a column 
    based on a formula we created. To analyze the data and create the graphs, RStudio was used 
    along with the tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, and kableExtra libraries. Windows 11 was the 
    platform used to complete this analysis.

## Section 3: Steps the group used and the instructions for reproducing the results: 
1. Gather Raw Data â€“ We secured a complete dataset of all airport departures from the U.S. Department of Transportaion [1] by downloading a dataset for each month. This data is located in the DATA folder. 
2. Filter Out Airports - For each data file, we went in and removed all rows where the ORIGIN column was not DTW, ATL, or ORD. We used Google Sheet's built in sort features to do so. 
3. Combine All Data - We created a master  Google Sheet called "Airports2023.xslx" and copy and pasted all data into this file. We used copy and paste because there is too much data to use built in merge features.
4. Create Day of the Week Column - We added a new column into the master datasheet called "day_of_week" next to the FL_DATE column and ran the following formula on each sell: =TEXT([Corresponding FL_DATE row], "dddd"). Example use is =TEXT(A3, "dddd").
5. Create Airport Column - ??????????
