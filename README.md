## Section 1: Software and Platform Section
    Google Sheets/Excel was used to clean and filter the data. This was chosen because there are 
    built in sort features to filter out the ORIGIN column and allow us to easily add a column 
    based on a formula we created. To analyze the data and create the graphs, RStudio was used 
    along with the tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, and kableExtra libraries. Windows 11 was the 
    platform used to complete this analysis.
